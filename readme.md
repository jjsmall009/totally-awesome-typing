# Time Attack Typing
This is the repo for my typing game made in Python. Well, it's not so much of a game
as it is a demo and general typing practice. One day I may gamify it more and add some
better game features.

## Phase 1 - 7/30/19
- [x] Setup and initialze repo and dev enviornment.
- [ ] Create main app window:
  - [ ] Title and difficutly button selections
- [ ] Gather words and group them into text files according to their difficulty.

## Notes
This "game" is just a time attack mode where you try and get the highest score possible
within the time limit.

The better you type the higher your combo gets so watch out for typos! Stuff.
